| POST | `/api/updates/unsubscribe` | Unsubscribe |

### 2.3 CSS Architecture

All custom properties are defined in **`tokens.css`** — load it first on every page.

**Token namespaces:**

| Variable | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--bg` / `--dark` | `#050807` | void black — same value, two names for legacy compat |
| `--text` | `#2aff8a` | signal green — canonical name for all green text |
| `--text-soft` | 88% opacity | near-signal green |
| `--text-muted` | 68% opacity | secondary/muted green — NOT the default `--mode-copy-muted` |
| `--text-readable` | `#e8f8ee` | warm cream — body copy in all modes; use via `--mode-copy` |
| `--text-readable-muted` | 62% cream | muted cream — used by `--mode-copy-muted` in all brand modes |
| `--accent` | `#2aff8a` | action/interactive green |
| `--relief` / `--relief-base` | `#d96aff` | relief magenta — canonical name is `--relief` |
| `--green-1/2/3` | 22/12/6% opacity | glow tiers |
| `--green-hot-1/2/3/4` | 75/55/38/22% opacity | active/hover tiers |

**Three brand modes** — set via `data-brand-mode` on `<body>`:

| Mode | Pages | Character |
|---|---|---|
| `ritual` | `/`, `/lab` | full theatrical intensity |
| `editorial` | `/books`, `/about`, `/gallery`, `/services` | readable, measured |
| `utility` | `/donate`, `/donate/thanks`, `/contact`, `/submit` | task-focused, calm |

Mode-scoped variables: `--mode-copy`, `--mode-copy-muted`, `--mode-border`, `--mode-border-strong`, `--mode-panel`, `--mode-panel-strong`, `--mode-shadow`, `--mode-heading-shadow`, `--mode-text-shadow`.

**CSS file roles:**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tokens.css` | All CSS custom properties + brand mode selectors |
| `interior-base.css` | All-page body/background/focus/grain/skip-link base styles |
| `portal.css` | `/` specific styles — overrides, animations |
| `layout.css` | `.page`, `.hero-bar`, `.site-header` grid |
| `components.css` | Cards, buttons, panels, tags — consume `--mode-*` vars |
| `forms.css` | Form inputs, validation states |
| `effects.css` | Grain texture, cursor glow |
| `hero-bar.css` | Fixed top navigation bar |
| `footer.css` | Page footer |
| `a11y.css` | Skip link, focus-visible |
| `fonts.css` | Self-hosted @font-face — Cinzel + Cormorant Garamond (12 woff2 subsets) |
| `books.css` / `gallery.css` / `mission.css` / `services.css` / `lab.css` / `donate-portal.css` | Page-specific |

### 2.4 Media Assets

Canonical media lives in `assets/source/`. Every shipped PNG, JPEG, WebP, SVG, and GIF variant must exist there; format conversion happens before accessioning, and sync does not generate variants. CSS, JavaScript, fonts, and the public asset README are authored directly under `apps/web/public/assets/`. Run `npm run assets:sync` after adding or changing canonical media, then `npm run assets:check` to verify source parity and both generated manifests.

| File | Format | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `img/identity/expedite-seal-source-2026.png` | PNG | Preserved source scan; never edit derivatives by hand |
| `img/identity/expedite-seal-master.svg` | SVG | Clean, recolorable institutional seal |
| `img/identity/expedite-seal-distressed.svg` | SVG | Distressed, recolorable display seal |
| `img/identity/expedite-seal-motion.svg` | SVG | Generated homepage-only ritual animation with static reduced-motion state |
| `img/identity/expedite-seal-green-768.*` | PNG/WebP | Homepage portal mark |
| `img/identity/expedite-seal-og-1200x630.*` | PNG/WebP | Default social preview |
| `img/crow_glitch_text_still.*` | PNG/WebP | Secondary ritual image; historical portal still |
| `img/crow_glitch_text.webp` / `gif/crow_glitch_text.gif` | WebP/GIF | Secondary ritual motion assets |
| `img/void_engine_twinkle_green.webp` | WebP | Background texture (preferred) |
| `img/void_engine_twinkle_green.png` | PNG | Background texture fallback |
| `img/favicon.svg` | SVG | Browser favicon; intentionally independent of the seal |
| `img/les-fievres-cover.svg` | SVG | Book cover |
| `img/covers/lift-wind-cover.webp` | WebP | *Lift Wind / Love Heat* cover (1024×1536) |

### 2.5 JavaScript Modules

All in `apps/web/public/assets/js/` — loaded via `<script is:inline>` or at bottom of body.

| File | Page | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `site-shell.js` | all | Global nav, view transitions |
| `index-effects.js` | `/` | Portal animation, animated webp swap |
| `donate-page.js` | `/donate` | Stripe checkout, preset buttons |
| `contact-page.js` | `/contact` | Form submit, API call |
| `submit-page.js` | `/submit` | Submission form |
| `gallery-page.js` | `/gallery` | Storefront API fetch, product render (ViewTransitions-safe) |
| `books-page.js` | `/books` | Projects API fetch |
| `lab-anglossic-*.js` | `/lab` | Anglossic Compass instrument |
| `form-utils.js` | forms | Shared validation helpers |
| `api-client.js` | forms | Shared fetch wrapper for Worker API |
| `dialog.js` | `/lab` | Modal dialog controller — manages aria-expanded on trigger |
| `updates-signup.js` | `/` mobile | Newsletter signup |

### 2.6 Runtime Dependencies

| Service | Binding | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| Cloudflare D1 | `DB` | `/api/projects`, `/api/updates*` |
| Resend | `RESEND_API_KEY` (secret) | `/api/contact`, `/api/submit` |
| Stripe | `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (secret) | `/api/donate/session`, `/api/stripe/webhook` |
| Fourthwall | `FOURTH_WALL_API_KEY` (secret) | `/api/storefront` |
| Cloudflare Turnstile | `TURNSTILE_SECRET` (secret) | form endpoints (currently unconfigured — bot check bypassed) |

**Pages deploy auth:** `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` + `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` (required env/CI secrets). Optional local override: `CF_PAGES_PROJECT`.

### 2.7 Key Config Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `apps/web/src/data/site.json` | Site metadata, nav, OG tags, per-page copy |
| `apps/web/astro.config.mjs` | Astro configuration |
| `apps/communications-worker/wrangler.toml` | Worker + D1 bindings (secrets documented in comments) |
| `package.json` | Workspace root scripts |
| `Makefile` | Make targets mirroring npm scripts |

## 3. Task Routing Loop

Before touching code:

1. Open `docs/ontology/project-ontology.json` — navigate and classify the task through the ontology
2. Read `docs/ontology/ontology.md` as the human-readable companion
3. **Classify** the task: `web`, `worker`, `docs`, `ops`, `assets`, `archive`, or `tooling`
4. **Read** `README.md`, `docs/state-of-play.md`, and the nearest domain README first
5. **Identify** owning source files — read before writing
6. **Keep edit surface narrow** — behaviour-preserving unless explicitly requested otherwise
7. **Update docs** in the same change when paths, commands, routes, or assets move (see §6)
8. **Run the narrowest meaningful validation**, escalating to `npm run check` for broad changes
9. **Close out with evidence:** tool calls, validation results, tooling/skills scrum (see §6.1)

For `web` tasks: read the target `.astro` file, its CSS stack, and any JS it references.  
For `worker` tasks: read `openapi.yaml` and `src/index.ts` before editing. Update OpenAPI when routes change.  
For media tasks: edit `assets/source/`, then `npm run assets:sync` and `npm run assets:check`. For CSS, JavaScript, or font assets, edit their owned public directories and run the same commands to refresh and verify manifests.
For `css` tasks: all custom properties are in `tokens.css`. Never hardcode colors with tokens. Use `--mode-*` vars in components.

**Task routing quick reference:**

| Task type | Read first | Run after |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Edit Astro page | Target `.astro`, its CSS, its JS | `npm run check` |
| Edit Worker route | `openapi.yaml`, `src/index.ts` | `npm run test:worker` |
| Add D1 migration | Latest migration file | `wrangler d1 execute … --file=migrations/NNNN_….sql` |
| Edit CSS token | `tokens.css`, affected pages | `npm run check:a11y` |
| Update docs / ontology | Affected docs + `project-ontology.json` | `npm run check:tooling-integrity` |
| Release | `docs/state-of-play.md`, last migration | `npm run release:dry-run` then `npm run release` |
| Add media | `assets/source/` | `npm run assets:sync && npm run assets:check` |

## 4. Command Matrix

```
npm run build            # Build Astro site → apps/web/dist/
npm run dev:web          # Astro dev server (localhost:4321)
npm run dev:worker       # Wrangler dev (Worker local)
npm run check            # Full gate: tooling-integrity + build + HTML lint + links + a11y + worker tests + audit
npm run check:links      # Broken link check
npm run check:a11y       # Accessibility heuristics
npm run check:audit      # Dependency audit (root, web, worker)
npm run check:tooling-integrity  # Ontology, path, and API route parity checks
npm run lint:html        # HTML validity
npm run test:worker      # Worker unit tests
npm run identity:build   # Rebuild seal derivatives from preserved source
npm run assets:sync      # Sync assets/source/ → apps/web/public/assets/
npm run assets:check     # Verify no asset drift
npm run runtime:config   # Check Cloudflare runtime bindings
npm run runtime:audit    # Read-only Worker/D1/schema audit
npm run smoke:api        # Production API smoke tests
npm run deploy:web       # Deploy Pages (requires CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN + CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID)
npm run deploy:worker    # Deploy Worker
npm run release:dry-run  # Dry-run release check
npm run release          # Full release
```

On Windows, root scripts that invoke shell files route through `scripts/run-bash.mjs` (WSL → Git Bash fallback).

## 5. Safety Rules

- **Never edit `apps/web/dist/`** — generated by `npm run build`
- **Never edit existing D1 migration files** — add a new numbered migration
- **Never commit secrets** — `.env`, `.dev.vars`, `.wrangler/`, `.dev.vars.*`
- **Keep `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, `.env`, `.dev.vars` out of version control**
- **Preserve public URLs** and `/api/*` response contracts unless a breaking change is explicitly requested
- **Treat `archive/` as read-only** unless explicitly asked to modify it
- **When touching CSS:** always load `tokens.css` first; use `--mode-*` vars in components; do not hardcode colors that have tokens; do not remove the grain texture or cursor glow
- **When touching assets:** keep media canonical in `assets/source/`; keep CSS/JS/fonts authored in their public directories; then sync and check

## 6. Source of Truth Updates

Update these together when their surfaces change:

| What changed | Update |
|---|---|
| Site routes or assets | `README.md`, `docs/state-of-play.md`, `apps/web/src/README.pages.md`, `AGENTS.md` §2 |
| Worker routes or payloads | `apps/communications-worker/openapi.yaml`, `apps/communications-worker/README.md`, `docs/infrastructure/`, `AGENTS.md` §2.2 |
| Tooling commands | `package.json`, `Makefile`, `scripts/README.md`, `AGENTS.md` §4 |
| Agent workflows | `AGENTS.md`, `skills/`, `CLAUDE.md` |
| CSS tokens or structure | `apps/web/public/assets/css/tokens.css`, `branding/tokens/`, `AGENTS.md` §2.3 |
| D1 schema | New migration file + `apps/communications-worker/README.md` |

When changing routes, commands, validation scripts, deployment/runtime surfaces, agent workflows, skills, runbooks, or maintained path ownership — update both `docs/ontology/project-ontology.json` and `docs/ontology/ontology.md`, then run `npm run check:tooling-integrity`.

### 6.1 Task Closeout

Every task that changes files or performs repo investigation must end with:

- **Tool calls:** concise list of commands, scripts, and repo tools used, grouped by purpose
- **Checks:** validation commands and outcomes
- **Tooling/skills scrum:** 1–3 notes on how to improve future tooling, skills, runbooks, or ontology rules

---

## 7. CSS Design System — Working Rules

Dark void aesthetic. Do not genericize it.

**Fonts:** Cinzel (display/headers/labels) · Cormorant Garamond (body/editorial) — self-hosted woff2 files in `apps/web/public/assets/fonts/`, declared via `fonts.css`.

**Color discipline:**
- Every UI color must be a token from `tokens.css`. No raw hex values in component CSS.
- Brand green: `--text` is canonical; `--green-base` and `--accent` are aliases — prefer `--text` in new code
- Body copy in all modes uses `--text-readable` (#e8f8ee warm cream), not green
- Use `--mode-copy` and `--mode-copy-muted` for text in components — mode system handles the value per page

**Component pattern:**
1. Pick a brand mode (`ritual` / `editorial` / `utility`) for the page
2. Use `--mode-*` vars for all borders, panels, shadows, and copy
3. Hover/focus states use `--green-hot-*` tiers
4. Validate at 900px and 768px breakpoints
5. Guard animations behind `prefers-reduced-motion`

**Do not:**
- Add new CSS files without a clear single-page or single-component scope
- Override `--mode-*` variables inline — override at the `data-brand-mode` level only
- Use `opacity` on text as sole legibility mechanism without checking contrast
- Remove the grain texture or cursor glow

---

## 8. Orchestration-First Subagent Policy

The primary agent is the orchestrator. Keep primary-agent context focused on planning, decomposition, integration, cross-surface decisions, validation, and critical blockers. Whenever work can be safely decomposed into independent read, implementation, review, or validation tracks, spawn subagents in parallel rather than serializing all work in the primary context.

Each subagent assignment must state:

- explicit task scope and success criteria;
- owned files or surfaces, including whether access is read-only or read/write;
- boundaries with other agents so edits do not overlap;
- expected output format and integration notes;
- raw artifact locations for logs, reports, patches, screenshots, or other evidence.

Subagents must preserve unrelated work and return both a concise result and the raw artifacts needed for primary-agent verification. The primary agent owns synthesis, conflict resolution, final validation, and any immediately critical blocker whose delegation would lose essential context.

Prefer built-in subagents when the runtime can select the requested model directly. If the runner cannot select `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`, the orchestrator must read `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` from the local environment and make bounded calls to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions` with model id `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`. Treat those calls as read-only delegated subagents.

- Use the key only in the orchestrator-built HTTP authorization header. Never print, log, commit, embed it in prompts, or pass it to a child agent or process.
- Each task packet declares a task ID, bounded objective, acceptance criteria, minimal artifact paths or excerpts, prohibited actions, and required output schema.
- Independent read-only calls may run concurrently; serialize overlapping or dependency-ordered tasks.
- Verify returned provider/model metadata, finish reason, and output shape before integration.
- Retry transient network, rate-limit, and server failures with bounded backoff. If OpenRouter, credentials, networking, or the requested model remain unavailable, use built-in runtime subagents and explicitly disclose the fallback.
- OpenRouter delegates may not write files, call other services, or mutate external state. The primary agent owns integration, every mutation, final validation, and closeout.

| Role | Owns |
|---|---|
| `web-surface` | Astro pages, CSS, JS, a11y, links |
| `worker-contract` | Worker routes, OpenAPI, D1 migrations, tests |
| `docs-curator` | Markdown, README, ontology consistency |
| `ops-release` | Cloudflare runtime checks, release scripts, smoke |
| `assets` | Media sync, format conversion, manifest |

Each skill in `skills/` is a self-contained agent definition:

| Skill | When to invoke |
|-------|---------------|
| `cloudflare-release-ops` | Pre-deploy runtime check, post-deploy verification |
| `docs-assay` | Documentation consistency review, ontology audit |
| `static-site-qa` | Full HTML + a11y + links + SEO gate |
| `worker-contract-review` | OpenAPI ↔ Worker source parity check |

### 8.1 Skill Generation and Curation Loop

Before creating a skill, inventory and search existing repo, installed, and available skills. Prefer updating or extending a suitable skill over creating a duplicate. For new or materially revised skills, follow the `skill-creator` structure, validate the skill and its referenced paths/scripts, then forward-test it with fresh subagents that did not share the authoring context.

Periodically curate the skill surface: consolidate overlapping workflows, update useful skills, and retire or archive stale duplicates without breaking maintained entrypoints. When a skill or workflow changes repository paths, commands, ownership, validation, or operating policy, update `AGENTS.md`, `docs/ontology/project-ontology.json`, and `docs/ontology/ontology.md` together.

## 9. MCP Tools

MCP servers are configured in the workspace root `.mcp.json` and are available to any agent working in this repository.

| Server | Use for this project |
|--------|---------------------|
| `playwright` | Visual testing of the live or dev site; interaction testing (nav, forms, dialogs); screenshot at specific viewports; console error capture |
| `playwright-ea` | API endpoint testing for Worker routes (`/api/*`) — fire POST/GET requests and assert responses alongside browser |
| `screenshot-fast` | Full-page screenshots of the live site (pass an HTTPS URL) or the dev server (pass `http://localhost:4321/...`) |
| `firecrawl` | Content extraction and crawl of stexpedite.press — extract page copy, structured data, and link inventory for audits |
| `page-design-guide` | Consult 2024–2026 design trends, typography, layout patterns, and accessibility guidance when evaluating or proposing design changes |

**Not typically needed for this project** (more relevant to design-iteration projects): `crawl4ai`, `web-cloner`, `design-copier`, `claude-design`.

### When to use MCP vs. npm scripts

| Task | Use |
|------|-----|
| Check the live site visually | `playwright` → navigate → screenshot |
| Audit all live pages at once | `firecrawl` scrape or `playwright` multi-page loop |
| Take full-page screenshots for design review | `screenshot-fast` with live URL |
| Test a Worker API endpoint manually | `playwright-ea` POST/GET |
| Check design direction before proposing changes | `page-design-guide` |
| Run automated HTML/links/a11y checks | `npm run check` (faster, no browser needed) |

### Viewports to test

| Viewport | Width | When |
|----------|-------|------|
| Desktop | 1280px | Always |
| Tablet | 768px | Layout breakpoints |
| Mobile | 390px | Nav scroll, form usability, portal layout |

## 11. Known Gaps and Future Work

### Site

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Turnstile missing from all forms | High | All POST forms (contact, submit, donate, updates, lab gate) have no Turnstile widget. No bot protection on any form. |
| `updates-signup.js` duplication | Low | `index.astro` has inline 80-line `wireUpdatesForm` that duplicates `updates-signup.js` — also duplicates `copyText` from `form-utils.js`. Extract to shared modules. |
| `donate/thanks` accessible without Stripe session | Low | Page is `noindex` but fully navigable without completing a donation. Low cosmetic trust risk. |
| OG image identical across all pages | Low | All 11 pages share the same crow OG image. Per-page OG images (book covers for `/books`) would improve social sharing differentiation. |

### Cloudflare Infrastructure

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ~~Turnstile~~ | ~~High~~ | ~~Resolved in v1.0.9~~ — `TURNSTILE_SECRET` live in Worker; widget on contact/submit/donate/updates; token sent in all POST bodies |
| `lift-wind` buy_url null | Medium | Migration `0015_buy_url_lift_wind.sql` ready — update placeholder and run once Amazon/vendor URL is confirmed |
| Rate limit generous for form endpoints | Low | `RATE_LIMIT_MAX=20` per IP/minute — consider 5 for POST mutation endpoints |
| `contact_submissions` no admin read endpoint | Low | Accessible only via wrangler CLI — add `/api/admin/submissions` if Resend reliability degrades |
| Legacy D1 query fallback | Low | `handleProjects` lines 993–1019: three-level nested try/catch for column existence — remove after confirming prod has all columns from migration 0012+ |
