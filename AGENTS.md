# St. Expedite Press — Agent Delegation Guide

This file governs how agents decompose and route work in this repository. It is the companion to `CLAUDE.md` and the preamble to `agent/AGENT.md` (the full project source of truth).

---

## Delegation Model

Every task entering this repo passes through three lenses before any file is touched:

1. **Classify** — what domain does this belong to? (`web`, `worker`, `docs`, `ops`, `assets`, `tooling`)
2. **Consult** — read `docs/ontology/project-ontology.json` to identify owning paths, valid commands, and contract surfaces
3. **Route** — assign to the narrowest responsible subagent below

The main agent does not write code. It decomposes tasks, routes to subagents, reviews results, and updates docs.

---

## Subagent Roster

| Role | Owns | When to spawn |
|------|------|---------------|
| `web-surface` | `apps/web/src/`, CSS, JS, a11y, links, Astro pages | Any page, style, or client-side behavior change |
| `worker-contract` | `apps/communications-worker/src/index.ts`, `openapi.yaml`, `migrations/`, `test/` | Any API route, D1 schema, or Worker env change |
| `docs-curator` | `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `agent/AGENT.md`, `docs/`, ontology JSON | Any documentation or ontology update |
| `ops-release` | `agent/ops/`, `agent/tools/release.sh`, `wrangler.toml`, smoke tests | Any deploy, runtime audit, or release gate task |
| `assets` | `assets/source/`, `npm run assets:sync`, `npm run assets:check` | Any image/media add or format conversion |

Spawn subagents in parallel when tasks are independent. Never delegate the immediately blocking task — complete it inline if it is narrow.

### Skills

Each skill in `agent/skills/` is a self-contained agent definition:

| Skill | When to invoke |
|-------|---------------|
| `cloudflare-release-ops` | Pre-deploy runtime check, post-deploy verification |
| `docs-assay` | Documentation consistency review, ontology audit |
| `static-site-qa` | Full HTML + a11y + links + SEO gate |
| `worker-contract-review` | OpenAPI ↔ Worker source parity check |

Each skill directory contains `SKILL.md` (instructions) and `agents/openai.yaml` (agent manifest).

### Ops Runbooks (`agent/ops/`)

The `cloudflare-stability` runbook governs the runtime health and release safety of the Cloudflare Worker and D1 database.

- `SKILL.md` — procedure overview
- `references/incident-response.md` — escalation and rollback steps
- `references/thresholds.md` — acceptable error rates, latency bounds
- `scripts/smoke-api.sh` — production endpoint smoke test (run via `npm run smoke:api`)
- `scripts/runtime-audit.sh` — read-only Cloudflare runtime audit (run via `npm run runtime:audit`)
- `scripts/log-release-evidence.sh` — post-deploy evidence capture

### Tools (`agent/tools/`)

Shell scripts invoked through `npm run` aliases defined in `package.json` and `Makefile`. Never invoke these directly without the `npm run` wrapper — the wrapper handles WSL/Git Bash routing on Windows.

## Task Routing Quick Reference

| Task type | Read first | Subagent | Run after |
|-----------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Edit Astro page | Target `.astro`, its CSS, its JS | `web-surface` | `npm run check` |
| Edit Worker route | `openapi.yaml`, `src/index.ts` | `worker-contract` | `npm run test:worker` |
| Add D1 migration | Latest migration in `migrations/` | `worker-contract` | `wrangler d1 execute … --file=migrations/NNNN_….sql` |
| Edit CSS token | `tokens.css`, affected pages | `web-surface` | `npm run check:a11y` |
| Update docs | Affected docs + ontology JSON | `docs-curator` | `npm run check:tooling-integrity` |
| Release | `docs/state-of-play.md`, last migration | `ops-release` | `npm run release:dry-run` then `npm run release` |
| Add media | `assets/source/` | `assets` | `npm run assets:sync && npm run assets:check` |

---

## Safety Rules

- Never edit `apps/web/dist/` — generated output only.
- Never edit existing D1 migration files — always add a new numbered file.
- Never commit `.env`, `.dev.vars`, `.wrangler/`, `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.local.md`.
- Preserve public URLs and `/api/*` response contracts unless a breaking change is explicitly authorized.
- When touching CSS: all colors must be tokens from `tokens.css`. No raw hex values in component CSS.
- When touching assets: edit `assets/source/` only, then sync and check.

## Source of Truth Chain

```
CLAUDE.md          → gateway, imports agent/AGENT.md, points here
AGENTS.md          → this file: delegation model + subagent roster
agent/AGENT.md     → full project ontology, CSS rules, command matrix, safety rules
docs/ontology/     → machine-readable constraint and path map
```

When these conflict: `agent/AGENT.md` wins for project facts; `AGENTS.md` wins for delegation policy.
