# Agent Guide

This folder collects concise but explicit instructions for maintaining and extending the neon portal. Follow these to preserve the established palette, motion language, and interaction behaviors.

## Structure
- `01-setup.md` — Local dev workflow (serve, tools, files to touch/avoid).
- `02-aesthetic.md` — Palette, typography, spacing, motion, textures, mood.
- `03-portal.md` — Splash behaviors (flash, crest, grid nav, cursor glow, textures).
- `04-theme.md` — Day/night toggle, storage key, defaults, ARIA.
- `05-assets.md` — Image/gif usage, optimization, placement, restrictions.
- `06-accessibility.md` — Focus, motion-reduction, contrast, semantics.
- `07-deploy.md` — Static hosting steps, preflight, post-deploy smoke checks.
- `08-filenaming.md` — File naming conventions for pages, assets, guides.
- `09-commands.md` — Command prompts for serving, searching, and inspecting.
- `10-structure.md` — Annotated, dated directory structure snapshot.

Add new guides as `NN-topic.md`, keeping them implementation-ready.
